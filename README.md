# Lung X-ray Classification using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to classify lung X-ray images. The goal is to distinguish between different lung conditions based on X-ray images.

## Project Structure

- `Lung_xray_classification.py`: The main script for training and evaluating the CNN model.
- **Data**: The dataset should be structured into `train` and `test` directories, each containing subdirectories for each class 

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib
